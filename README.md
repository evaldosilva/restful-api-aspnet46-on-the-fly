## Restful Api ASP .Net 4.6 on-the-fly

Some on-the-fly ASP .Net apis with random functions to support some of these GitHub projects. 
Actually it is hosted at somee.com, with endpoints like [http://evaldosilva.somee.com/api/Fibonacci](http://evaldosilva.somee.com/api/Fibonacci) for instance, that is from this project.

I've choosen this version of the full .Net Framework and not the .Net Core, for instance, because somee.com free hosting just supports it or older versions (4.5, 4.0...). This is the major .Net version supported today on free account.

### Usage
Feel free to use these endpoints, but it has the somee.com access restrictions, written in their [terms of use](https://somee.com/TermsOfService.aspx). 

### Thanks!
